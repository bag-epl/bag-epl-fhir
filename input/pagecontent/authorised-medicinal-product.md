### Introduction

The EPL requires a data import from SMC and from the Marketing Authorisation Holders. The dataformat is based on FHIR IDMP.

### Data Pipeline
The following datapipeline illustrates the dataflow within the EPL from the data sources SMC and Marketing Authorisation Holder to the Federal Office for Public Health, and the Export of the Spezialit√§tenliste.

For the Dataimport the FHIR format must be used.

### FHIR Document Bundle
This exchange format is defined as a document type that corresponds to a Bundle as a FHIR resource. A Bundle has a list of entries. The first entry is the Composition, in which all contained entries are then referenced.

#### Datastructure
The following table indicates the dataelements as build in the FHIR structure. The color coding of IDMP ISO 11615 datamodel has been used to group the different dataelement.

The structure indicates all the dataelement that will be delivered to ePL. However, the datainput in FHIR format to ePL is not yet ready and in 2024 still under development.
