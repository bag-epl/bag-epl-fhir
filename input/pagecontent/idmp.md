### Introduction

ISO 11615 is a standard within the IDMP framework that provides guidelines for uniquely identifying medicinal products. The standard defines a set of data elements and structures that should be used for the identification of medicinal products throughout their lifecycle.

### Key Components
Key components of ISO 11615 include:

1. **Data Elements:**
   - Product Name
   - Pharmaceutical Form
   - Strength
   - Route of Administration
   - Manufacturer Details

2. **Data Structures:**
   - Defines how the identified data elements should be organized and structured to ensure consistency and interoperability across different systems and organizations.

3. **Lifecycle Management:**
   - Addresses the need for consistent identification throughout the entire lifecycle of a medicinal product, from development and regulatory approval to post-marketing phases.

4. **Interoperability:**
   - Aims to facilitate the exchange of medicinal product information between different stakeholders, such as regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare providers.

Adopting ISO 11615 helps streamline regulatory processes, improve patient safety, and enhance the efficiency of information exchange within the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors globally.
